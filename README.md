# Introduction

### The project focuses on SyriaTel, a telecommunications company facing customer churn issues due to increased competition. Our aims to develop predictive models to forecast customers that are likely to leave, thus helping SyriaTel retain its customer base.

The dataset used for analysis, named `telecom_dataset`. 
It contains information about customers using SyriaTel's services. 
It can be accessed on Kaggle. 
The dataset has 3333 rows and 21 columns in CSV format.

The columns include information such as state, account length, area code, phone number, international plan, voice mail plan, call details (day, evening, night, international), and customer service calls, along with a churn indicator.

There are no missing values in the dataset. 
We import relevant libraries for data analysis and machine learning tasks, including pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

The dataset telecom_dataset.csv has been loaded into a DataFrame named df. 
Here's an exploration of the dataset:
